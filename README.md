# Playground

The playground repository is used to synchronize codes and notebook pieces among PCs. The codes and notebooks stored in this repository is mainly for learning and testing purpose. Some of the codes might be recycled and used in the "A Notebook Series" project.

Notice that "A Notebook Series" project mainly focuses on theories and algorithms used in mathematics, physics, engineering and finance, but not programming. Hence, "A Notebook Series" will not take into any scripts or notebooks in this repository entirely.

The codes in this repository, if not elsewhere mentioned, are tested on a PC with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.1. The code editor is by default Microsoft Visual Studio Code. In some rare occasions, vim might be used an an alternative.
