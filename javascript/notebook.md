# JavaScript Runtime Setup

## Browser-Based JavaScript Runtime

Many web browsers, including Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, have so called "developer tools" that allows the user to check and test JavaScript codes using the browser. The outcome of the code can be immediately displayed on the browser.

Take Microsoft Edge as an example. To setup a browser-based JavaScript runtime on Edge, open a blank page with URL `about:blank`. Then press `F12` to open the developer tools. Select "Console" in the developer tools. The user can then test JavaScript codes using the console.

For quick demonstration, type the following in the console
```
alert("Hello World!")
```
then press `Enter`. An alert message that says "Hello World!" shall pop up.
## VSCode-Based JavaScript Runtime

Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a very powerful and flexible text and program editor. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
